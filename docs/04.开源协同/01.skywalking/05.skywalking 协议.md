# 概述

目前skywalking 主要的协议有

- [ Trace Data Protocol v3](https://skywalking.apache.org/docs/main/latest/en/protocols/trace-data-protocol-v3/#trace-data-protocol-v3)

- [skywalking-data-collect-protocol](https://github.com/apache/skywalking-data-collect-protocol)

- [HTTP API Protocol ](https://skywalking.apache.org/docs/main/latest/en/protocols/http-api-protocol/#http-api-protocol)



# HTTP API Protocol

# 术语

### SpanType

- EntrySpan EntrySpan represents a service provider, which is also the endpoint on the server end. As an APM system, SkyWalking targets the application servers. Therefore, almost all the services and MQ-consumers are EntrySpans.
- LocalSpan LocalSpan represents a typical Java method which is not related to remote services. It is neither a MQ producer/consumer nor a provider/consumer of a service (e.g. HTTP service).
- ExitSpan ExitSpan represents a client of service or MQ-producer. It is known as the `LeafSpan` in the early stages of SkyWalking. For example, accessing DB by JDBC, and reading Redis/Memcached are classified as ExitSpans.
